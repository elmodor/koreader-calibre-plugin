A calibre plugin to synchronize metadata from KOReader to calibre.

[KOReader](https://koreader.rocks/) creates sidecar files that hold read progress and annotations. This plugin reads the data from those sidecar files and updates calibre's metadata based on them. It is inspired by [the Kobo Utilities plugin](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=215339), that synchronizes reading progress between the original Kobo firmware (“Nickel”) and custom columns in calibre.

Note that at the moment the sync is primarily one-way—from the KOReader device to calibre — and only works for USB and [wireless](https://github.com/koreader/koreader/wiki/Calibre-wireless-connection) devices. For the latter, you'll need [KOReader 2021.04 or newer](https://github.com/koreader/koreader/releases).

Pushing metadata from Calibre to KOReader currently works only for books which do not have KOReader sidecar files, and of course requires the raw metadata column to be mapped. The use-case is for e.g. setting up a new device, or if a book was removed from your device and you've now added it back. This has been tested for Calibre's Connect to Folder and Custom USB Device modes. It does not seem to work for the Kobo Touch device driver nor with wireless connections, but I (@charlesangus) find those don't communicate perfectly with Calibre/KOReader in any case... I haven't disabled it for other devices - it may be a quirk in my setup which is causing it to fail, and it may work fine for you.

Releases will also be uploaded to [this plugin thread on the MobileRead Forums](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?p=4060141). If you are on there as well, please let me know what you think of the plugin in that thread.

## Using this plugin

### Download and install

1. Go to your calibre's “Preferences” > “Plugins” > “Get new plugins” and search for “KOReader Sync”
2. Click “Install”
3. Restart calibre

#### Alternatively

1. Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/harmtemolder/koreader-calibre-plugin/tree/main/releases).
2. Go to your calibre's “Preferences” > “Plugins” > “Load plugin from file” and point it to the downloaded ZIP file
3. Restart calibre

### Setup

1. Pick and choose the metadata you would like to sync and create the appropriate columns in calibre. These are your options:
    - A “Floating point numbers” column to store the **current percent read**, with “Format for numbers” set to `{:.0%}`.
    - An “Integers” column to store the **current percent read**.
    - A regular “Text” column to store the **location you last stopped reading at**.
    - A “Rating” column to store your **rating** of the book, as entered on the book's status page.
    - A “Long text” column to store your **review** of the book, as entered on the book's status page.
    - A “Long text” column to store your **bookmarks and highlights** of the book, with “Interpret this column as” set to “Plain text formatted using markdown”. (Highlights are an unordered list with their metadata in an HTML comment.)
    - A regular “Text” column to store the **reading status** of the book, as entered on the book status page (“Finished”, “Reading”, “On hold”).
    - A “Date” column to store **the date on which the first highlight or bookmark was made**. (This is probably around the time you started reading.)
    - A “Date” column to store **the date on which the last highlight or bookmark was made**. (This is probably around the time you finished reading.)
    - A regular “Text” column to store the **MD5 hash** KOReader uses to sync progress to a [**KOReader Sync Server**](https://github.com/koreader/koreader-sync-server#koreader-sync-server). (“Progress sync” in the KOReader app.) This might allow for syncing progress to calibre without having to connect your KOReader device, in the future.
    - A “Long text” column to store the **raw contents of the metadata sidecar**, with “Interpret this column as” set to “Plain text”. This is required to sync metadata back to KOReader sidecars.
10. Add “KOReader Sync” to “main toolbar when a device is connected”, if it isn't there already.
11. Right-click the “KOReader Sync” icon and “Configure”.
12. Map the metadata you want to sync to the newly created calibre columns.
13. Click “OK” to save your mapping.
14. From now on just click the “KOReader Sync” icon to sync all mapped metadata for all books on the connected device to calibre.

### Things to consider

- The plugin overwrites existing metadata in Calibre without asking. That usually isn’t a problem, because you will probably only add to KOReader’s metadata. But be aware that you might lose data in calibre if you’re not careful.
- Pushing sidecars back to KOReader currently only happens for sidecars which are missing. For now, manually delete the `<bookname>.sdr` folder from the device before attempting to push the sidecars back to KOReader for any books you would like to overwrite the current metadata with Calibre's metadata.
- When pushing missing sidecars to the device, no attempt is made to convert Calibre's metadata to account for changes in KOReader's sidecar format. Old metadata may work unpredictably if it's from a different version of KOReader.

### Supported devices

This plugin has been tested successfully with:

- Kobo Aura connected over USB, which means it will probably work for all comparable Kobo devices (`KOBO` and `KOBOTOUCH`)
- Kobo Aura H2O over USB (`KOBOTOUCHEXTENDED`, see [#6](https://todo.sr.ht/~harmtemolder/koreader-calibre-plugin/6) for details)
- Kobo Aura connected wirelessly, which means it will probably work for all calibre connect devices (`SMART_DEVICE_APP`)
- A connected folder (`FOLDER_DEVICE`)
- Kindle Keyboard (`KINDLE2`, see [#1](https://todo.sr.ht/~harmtemolder/koreader-calibre-plugin/1) for details)
- Tolino Vision 4 HD (`TOLINO`, see [this comment](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showpost.php?p=4179705&postcount=28) for details)
- PocketBook Touch Lux 5 (which uses the `POCKETBOOK626` driver, so it will probably work for all comparable PocketBook devices, see [#8](https://todo.sr.ht/~harmtemolder/koreader-calibre-plugin/8) for details)
- PocketBooks that use the `POCKETBOOK622` driver

This plugin is not compatible with:

- `MTP_DEVICE` (see [#2](https://todo.sr.ht/~harmtemolder/koreader-calibre-plugin/2) for details)

## Contributing to this plugin

### Notes & Tips

- My first attempt was actually to sync calibre with KOReader's read progress through the progress sync plugin and a [sync server](https://github.com/koreader/koreader-sync-server). Read [here](https://github.com/koreader/koreader/issues/6399#issuecomment-721826362) why that did not work. This plugin might actually make that possible now by allowing you to store KOReader's MD5 hash in calibre...
- calibre allows you to auto-connect to a folder device on boot, which greatly speeds up your workflow when testing. You can find this under “Preferences” > “Tweaks”, search for `auto_connect_to_folder`. Point that to the `dummy_device` folder in this repository. (I have included royalty free EPUBs for your and my convenience.)
- If you're testing and don't actually want to update any metadata, set `DRY_RUN` to `True` in `__init__.py`.
- I work in PyCharm, which offers a remote debugging server. To enable that in this plugin, set `PYDEVD` to `True` in `__init__.py`.You might need to change `sys.path.append` in `action.py`.
- The supported device drivers can be found in [the `SUPPORTED_DEVICES` list in `config.py`](https://github.com/harmtemolder/koreader-calibre-plugin/blob/main/config.py#L30). Adding a new type here is the first step to adding support, but make sure all features are tested thoroughly before releasing a version with an added device

### Testing in calibre

Use make to load the plugin into calibre and launch it:

```shell
make dev
```

Alternatively, build a release and load that:

```shell
make zip load
```

### Building a release

Make sure you have the dependencies and have set the correct version number in `__init__.py`, `pluginIndexKOReaderSync.txt` and `Makefile`. Also update [Changelog](#Changelog). Then:

```shell
make zip
```

### Debugging a release

1. Download the required release from [here](https://github.com/harmtemolder/koreader-calibre-plugin/tree/main/releases)
1. Add it to calibre by running this in your terminal: `calibre-customize -a "KOReader Sync vX.X.X-alpha.zip"`, where `X.X.X` refers to the version you downloaded
1. Start calibre in debug mode with `calibre-debug -g`
1. Configure the KOReader plugin as described [here](https://github.com/harmtemolder/koreader-calibre-plugin#setup)
1. Connect your device
1. Run the sync by clicking the KOReader icon in your toolbar
1. Check the details of the message when it's done if any/all books have been synced correctly
1. Check your (custom) columns for one of those books to see if their contents are what they should be
1. Check the output in your terminal for lines containing `koreader` to see what it did

## Changelog
